Internship Reviewer Application (INTERNOVA)

**2. Background of the problem**
- Lack of Structured Feedback: Many internship programs lack a standardized and structured feedback system for interns, which makes it difficult for interns to assess their performance and for organizations to evaluate the success of the internship program.
- Limited Communication Channels: Interns often feel disconnected from mentors or supervisors due to insufficient communication channels, resulting in missed opportunities for guidance, feedback, and career development.
- Inconsistent Evaluation Criteria: The evaluation of interns can be inconsistent across different departments or organizations, leading to unfair or subjective assessments that may not accurately reflect the intern’s work and contributions.
- Difficulty in Tracking Internship Progress: Interns and employers face challenges in tracking the progress and achievements throughout the internship period, which can impact both the intern’s growth and the organization’s ability to identify areas for improvement in the program.
